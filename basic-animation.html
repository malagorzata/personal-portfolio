This included creating paper prototype, design game elements as well as adding self-recorded audio sounds. Additionially, we learnt designing Activity and State Machine Diagrams. </p>

                        <h3>PROCESS</h3>
                        <p class="cardcontent"> The design of the game is based around flat and Kawaii design. Therefore, I chose flat design to highlight the resemblance to Japanese art. The process started with creating paper prototype of the game and using peer review to check the idea. Peer reviews allowed to improve the game through testing the overall game idea. Later, I designed State Machine Diagram that made the process of coding JS easier. It required thinking through every click and ensuring that the design is intuitive for the player. The game was tested on multiple people as testing proved to be highly important in the previous tasks. Thanks to feedback, I slowed down the animation times to ensure better game experience.

                        <p class="cardcontent"> This assignment has taught me the <b>basis of JS</b> and its application alongside HTML and CSS. Moreover, this project has improved my skill of holistically thinking while working on the game from very start to the end. Additionially, I have improved my <b>AI skills</b> as well as have learnt to use <b>Adobe Audition</b>. Through utilisations the tools such as <b>Activity and State Machine Diagram</b>, I was able to spot any issues or functionality gaps that improved the coding process. </p>
